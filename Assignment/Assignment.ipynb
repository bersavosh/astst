    "- The assignment is a single Jupyter notebook, containing 2 questions (each with multiple parts).\n",
    "- You are free to use code snippets from the tutorial notebooks.\n",
    "- The assignment also has five associated text files, which contain the input data for analysis in the assignment. These files are automatically read in within the notebook. They simply need to be in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook file. These files are available in the github repository. **If you're using the Binder server, you do not need take any action outside the notebook environment to read the files**. If you are running the notebook on your own local setup, you need to download and put them in the same folder as the notebook.\n",
    "- If you use the Binder server, make sure to save frequently (e.g., after your work on every question), and download your work after every session. You can re-upload your partially complete work in your next session to continue working on it.\n",
    "- Sometimes Binder server launch can fail. If that happens restart the launch. If the problem persists, contact me (via email/slack/in-person/etc).\n",
    "- You can submit your completed notebook either as a Jupyter notebook (preferred) or as a PDF version of the notebook through Blackboard.\n",
    "- Some questions may require you to define new python variables/functions and test your work by running cells over and over or add new cells for yourself to check/test. This is fine. Just make sure that after you have tested what you return is a clean notebook that runs smoothly and only has the output that is requested in each question.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before submission, make sure that your notebook can be executed in a single run from beginning to end. E.g., by clicking the <kbd>Restart & Run All</kbd> under the <kbd>Kernel</kbd> menu. If there are questions/parts that you have left blank or incomplete, which do not allow a complete computational run to be executed, comment them out and add an explanation about your partial work in the same cell (as a python comment block)."

The smallest and largest values of $m$ and $d$ which satistfy the condition are your error bounds (based on which you can calculate uncertainties). Your grid doesn't need to be very large, and the range and grid resolution for each of $m$ and $d$ can be guessed from your calculations for the previous cells above. Note that this method is only one way to estimate the uncertainties. You are free to explore/use other methods. "
